        <h2>Late Nights & Early Mornings</h2>
        <p class="date">April 6, 2025</p>
        <p>There’s something oddly peaceful about studying at dawn, when everyone else is still asleep. I usually take my first sip of coffee around 5 AM while trying to finish assignments I meant to do the night before (relatable?). If you're like me, coffee isn’t just a drink—it’s a survival tool. And here at Dawn and Sunset Cafe, it feels like home.</p>

        <h2>Friendships Built Over Coffee</h2>
        <p class="date">March 25, 2025</p>
        <p>
          School isn’t just about lectures and exams. It’s the conversations between classes, the shared deadlines, and that one friend who reminds you to submit before 11:59 PM. We've made countless memories here at the cafe—whether it's group studies, heart-to-hearts, or shared silence over a hot cup of mocha.

        <h2>Balancing School and Life</h2>
        <p class="date">March 10, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Being a working student is no joke. Between deadlines, group works, and part-time shifts, it’s hard to find time to breathe. That’s why we created a space where students like us can pause, reflect, and recharge. Sometimes, all you need is a quiet corner and good coffee to feel okay again.
